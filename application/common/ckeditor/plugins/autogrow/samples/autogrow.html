		<p>
			This sample shows how to configure CKEditor instances to use the
			<strong>AutoGrow</strong> (<code>autogrow</code>) plugin that lets the editor window expand
			and shrink depending on the amount and size of content entered in the editing area.
		</p>
		<p>
			In its default implementation the <strong>AutoGrow feature</strong> can expand the
			CKEditor window infinitely in order to avoid introducing scrollbars to the editing area.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is also possible to set a maximum height for the editor window. Once CKEditor
			editing area reaches the value in pixels specified in the
			<code><a class="samples" href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-autoGrow_maxHeight">autoGrow_maxHeight</a></code>
			configuration setting, scrollbars will be added and the editor window will no longer expand.
